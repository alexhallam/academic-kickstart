The suckless team has the [sent](tools.suckless.org/sent/) tools.
It is a plaintext presentation tool. 

### Getting started

--------------------

```
git clone https://git.suckless.org/farbfeld
git clone https://git.suckless.org/sent
sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-turbo-dev
```

I then built farbfeld and sent with `make clean install`.

----------------------

The first thing I learned is that `sent` does not export
a presentation as any format. No pdf, jpg, png. `sent` 
is a presentation tool. I played with the color a little.

```
static const char *colors[] = {
	"#A7A37E", /* foreground color */
	"#002F2F", /* background color */
};
```

I was suprised that transparent images are allowed, but the 
test image was a `*.ff` (farbfeld) format. I don't think that
png is supported.
