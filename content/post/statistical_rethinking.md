This is probably one of the more popular Bayes books around for broad audiences. I 
think it is a great book. He is a good story teller. Some concepts, like Markov Chains,
are normally introduced with formula. He approaches Markov with a story of a King 
needing to visit various islands of his kingdon equal in proportion to the 
count of citizens on the islands. I am not doing the story justice here. I would 
reccomend you read the book to get the "punch-line" of the Markov Chain story
and others. 

He also brings interesting 'history of science/statistics' into his writting.
When he talks about predictive models he tells the story of how Capernicous's model of 
the solar system was a very predictive model even though it was a wrong model. Those
stories have a way of sticking around. 

Some things I did not care for: 

1. I did not like the heavy use of his homegrown companion package. He says himself that this is used as scaffolding and
   he expects is readers to move onto `rstan`. He ends up using rstan a lot at the end. (For interested readers there is
   a `brms` rework of the main body of code.  You will be able to find with a quick google search.) In fairness I could
   see how his package could be useful to new users. Though Stan is simple its integration to R or Python is an
   additional layer of complexity. 

2. Sometime the introduction to the material was too verbose for me. I have had Bayes coursework and read some Bayes
   books before this one. If this is not your first rodeo then maybe you will have the same experience.

If you are interested in this book I know a second edition is coming soon. I would also make sure to check out
the companion video lectures. Richard McEleath is an great teacher. Also check out the `brms` code.
