I read this book many years ago. I thought it provided a good deal of code
that is still usable today. I remember using it to write my [Kaplan-Meier 
curve Julia packagae](https://github.com/alexhallam/TimeToX.jl). 

It hits the main points on survival analysis and provides
some code for implementation. It is a nice small read and a good 
reference.
