`baysm` is the R package used as a companion to this book. I think that the 
package is slightly more difficult to use than other packages. I think that
it would be nice if the case studies were revisited with Stan or brms. 

The Amazon reviews rave about the case studies. Those reviews are on point!
The case study I reviewed the most was "Case Study 2". This case study even
served as inspiration for a work project I was working on last year. 

"Case Study 3: Overcoming Scale Usage Heterogeneity" was a interesting read.
I think anyone who has ever had to work with survey data knows that it is a 
pain. Straight lining (all one value) and to-fast-to-be-true need to be 
dealt with. Also different people have different senses for what a 5-out-of-5
means. Some respondents hand out perfect scores freely and others would never
hand out a perfect 5. The book offers some tools for working with these problems.
While I think the methods they introduce are useful I think that surveys come 
baked with so many problems that we can't get away from.

The beginning of the book reviews Bayes approach to estimation. Every Bayes
book I have read has a review of Bayes approach to estimation. Their review 
is probably one of the more math heavy introductions.

I think the book is a worth while read.
