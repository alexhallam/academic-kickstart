This is likely one of the top 3 statistics books I have read. This is much more than just a
regression book. It is a book on statistical practice. I learned the value of
small and comparative plots. I learned the "Secret Weapon" of statistic, which
is fitting models grouped by some time --- usually year --- and observe the
change in coefficients over time. 

I like how much time he spend on introducing hierarchical models. He also
discuses alternative, less formal, approaches that he has seen in the wild. 

I can't say enough good things about this book.
